        <h1>My values</h1>
        <p>
            Hi. I'm WhiteBlackGoose, and here is what I think is right and wrong. These 
            values are what possible in today's world.

          <h2>I'm pro...</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Individualism</li>
            <li>Right for gender self-identification. Your gender does not limited you at anything - thus you're free to choose.</li>
            <li>Right for nationality self-identification. Nobody is born "Swedish" (or any other nationality) - 
                you can only become one, by learning its culture and agreeing with its values.</li>
            <li>Right for culture self-identification. You don't have to be born in a cultural environment to be part of it.</li>
            <li>Right for self-expression. Nobody is a "weirdo".</li>
            <li>Expansion of definition of marriage to any two adults, regardless of their self-identities.</li>
            <li>Free migration. Give everyone a chance to live a good life.</li>
            <li>Free movement. You can move work/study/live to another city or country without barriers.</li>
            <li>Free speech. Everyone has a right to be heard, unless the message contradicts previous points or human rights.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          <h2>I'm against...</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Abuse of free speech. Free speech is when everyone has a right to contribute to the society. Any xenophobia does not contribute to it</li>
            <li>Abuse of social benefits. WIP</li>
          </ul>

            These values are, however, limited by today's world.
            In fact, my ideals stretch far beyond these values.
