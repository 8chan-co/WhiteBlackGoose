        <h1>Why YYYY-MM-DD date format is the best</h1>
        <p>
            I keep seeing Europeans and Americans arguing on reddit whether
            it should be DD/MM/YYYY or MM/DD/YYYY. I've always disagreed with
          both, let me give you a few reasons why.
          *Disclaimer: the arguments here are mostly for people who read from the left*

         <h2>1. Consistency with other measurements</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, how do we write numbers? Take **645**. Its first
      (reading from the left) digit is **6**, the most significant digit. So
      when you consider a price of a product, you most likely will care more
      about its major units than those minor (e. g. "six hundred dollars" is not 
      much different from "six hundred fourty five").
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's take something else. For example, time, which we write as
          "15:45" and read starting from its major units. See the pattern?
        </p>
        <p>
          In **yyyy-mm-dd** it's the same. Starting from the most major unit,
          ending with a minormost one.
        </p>

            In fact, my ideals stretch far beyond these values.
