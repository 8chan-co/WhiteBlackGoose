### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm WhiteBlackGoose. Who cares about my bio?

I mainly work on our symbolic-algebra library <a href="https://github.com/asc-community/AngouriMath">AngouriMath</a> (under MIT). I also created a generic tensor library <a href="https://github.com/asc-community/GenericTensor">GenericTensor</a>. I'm also @MomoDeve's friend and sometimes help him with his game engine <a href="https://github.com/asc-community/MxEngine">MxEngine</a>.

I wrote a few articles, maybe some people will be interested in them:
1. <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/a-simple-simulation-of-custom-physical-interaction">Simple simulation of custom physical interactions with particles</a>
2. <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/465523/">Yet another snake with Kivy, Python</a>
3. <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/486496/">Symbolic algrebra in C#</a> (quite outdated though, written at the very beginning of AngouriMath)
4. <a href="https://gist.github.com/WhiteBlackGoose/5b84b2237704a91ffe7f34372196df32">Generic tensors in C#</a>
